# Base URL of the application (used in emails and links)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Port to run the application server on
PORT=3000

# Node environment: one of 'development', 'testing', or 'production'
# - development: no emails sent, dev verification code accepted, any email allowed
# - testing: emails sent, only users from ALLOWED_DOMAINS permitted
# - production: emails sent, any domain permitted, but only ALLOWED_DOMAINS see admin dashboard
NODE_ENV=development

# Session secret used to sign and validate sessions
# Use a secure, random value in production

# === Email Configuration ===
#
# Configure the email settings used by the backend to send automated messages to users and administrators.
#
# Emails are sent in the following cases:
# - To send verification codes to users when logging in or signing up
# - To send Subject Access Request (SAR) data to users
#   (Users can request this once per day. It includes a human- and machine-readable copy of their full user record.
#   See the documentation in README.md for more information.)
# - To send notifications to users when leases they have bookmarked are updated
#   (Users can disable these notifications on their profile screen.)
# - To send alerts to administrators when new bug reports are submitted (coming soon)
# - To send alerts to administrators when new data releases are available from HM Land Registry (coming soon)
# - To alert adminsitrators of excessive tool use (coming soon)

# Email Sending Configuration
# ===============================

# Method used to send emails. Only 'smtp' is currently supported.
# In future you can extend this to support 'graph'.
EMAIL_METHOD=smtp

# Sender email address (appears in the "from" field of outgoing emails)
EMAIL_FROM=         # e.g. no-reply@yourdomain.org

# SMTP server hostname (e.g. smtp.gmail.com for Gmail, or your Microsoft 365 MX record)
EMAIL_HOST=         # e.g. smtp.gmail.com

# SMTP server port:
# - 587 for TLS (authenticated SMTP)
# - 25 for unauthenticated IP-based relay (Microsoft 365)
EMAIL_PORT=         # e.g. 587 or 25

# Optional: SMTP username and password for authenticated sending (e.g. Gmail)
EMAIL_USER=         # e.g. youruser@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=         # e.g. Gmail App Password or SMTP password

# ===============================
# Notes:
# - If EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are provided, authentication will be used.
# - If not provided, the app will attempt to send via unauthenticated SMTP relay.
# - For Microsoft 365 unauthenticated relay, ensure your server's IP is allowlisted
#   and EMAIL_FROM matches a valid domain in their tenant.
